    For example: turning a numeric "num_in_family" into "family_small",

    There are multiple ways to define bins. Uniform or quantiles are two
    examples.

    Uniform: bins are equidistant. Quantiles: bins are set based on quantiles
    (e.g., 10% of the data in each bin). Bins will be different sizes (smaller
    ranges when there is more data, larger when less data), but contain the same
    number of points.

    Why bin? Binning gives linear models more flexability. A linear model will
    give a different value for each bin, which ideally is closer to the data.
    When the data is not truly linear, binning allows the linear model to
    predict closer to actuals for each bin (ideally).

    When bin? Bin features when their data is not truly linear. Understand the
    error both before and after binning (build a linear model with just one
    feature) to see how binning lowers or raises the overall error.

    Do *NOT* bin data when working with trees. Trees choose their own bins
    (sometimes in combinations with other features). Binning actually decreases
    predictive power when working with trees.

    Interaction features are created by combining features together. For

    create a `miles_per_hour` feature which reduces the feature space without
    losing any modeling power.

    Polynominal features are x^^2 or x^^3. They provide curvature to the line of
    best fit.

    Why create interaction and/or polynominal features?

    Using polynomial features makes the line of best fit to better curve with
    the data. Note that polynomials of high degree behave in extreme ways on
    boundaries or regions with little data.

    Note that using a more complex model (SVM), we can learn a similarly complex
    prediction without transforming features.

    features. Performance of tree based models (or any model for that matter)

    Tree based models only care about the ordering of the features. Linear
    models are tied to the scale and distribution of data. If there is a

    Applying non-linear functions to features (log, exp) can make feature values
    Gaussian distributed.

    This helps with features like counts, which are never negative and tend to
    have long tails. `log`, for example, transforms data into a symmetrical
    shape and reduces outliers.

    Remember: Nonlinear transformations can help simple linear models (and NNs
    to some extent). Nonlinear transformations are irrelevant to tree based
    models.

    More complex models, like SVMs, kNN, and NNs *may* benefit from binning,
