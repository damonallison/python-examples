"""Model evaluation includes the following:

* Determining how a model performs on unseen (test) data.
* Hyperparameter tuning to build an optimal model (GridSearchCV).


Model Evaluation
----------------
Simple model evaluation is done with the `score` method (classification) or
accuracy metrics (MAE, RMSE for regression). `score` is different for every
model type. The metrics used for scoring vary based on the model type.

Classification scoring:

* Accuracy
* Precision / Recall / F1
* ROC-AUC
* Confusion matrix

Regression scoring:

* MAE / MSE / RMSE
* R^2


For classification models, `accuracy` is returned. For regression models, R^2 is
returned which represents the proportion of variance in the dependent variable
that is predicted from the independent variables (features).

R^2 = 1 - (sum of squared residuals / total sum of squares)

* Sum of squared residuals = sum of squared differences between the actual and
  predicted values.

* Total sum of squares: Sum of squared differences between the actual values and
  the mean of the dependent variable.


R^2 provides a measure of how well the model captures variability in the data.
It does *not* indicate whether the model is appropriate for making predictions
on new data. Therefore, it is often used in conjunction with other methods (like
RMSE).

Regression model metrics:

* Mean Absolute Error (MAE): The average absolute differences between predicted
  and actual values.

* Mean Squared Error (MSE): Average of the squared differences between predicted
  and actual values.

* Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): The root of MSE. RMSE is interpretable since
  it shares the same unit as the dependent variable.

Note that RMSE is sensitive to outliers. Typically both RMSE and R^2 are used
together to score a regression model.

Scaling
-------
Models that are distance based (kNN, linear regression, logistic regression,
NNs) are subject to scaling imbalances. **Scale data before model training**.

Cross Validation
----------------
Cross validation is a process of training and validating multiple models on
different slices of data. Cross validation is more robust since it ensures the
entire data set is used as the test set in one fold. There are multiple CV
strategies available, however KFold, StratifiedKFold, and GroupKFold are the
most common.

Learning Curves
---------------
Plots that show the model's performance on both training and validation datasets
ofer different training sizes or epochs.

---

Grid Search (Hyperparameter Tuning)
-----------------------------------
Grid search is the process of finding the best model hyperparameters by
"searching" thru a grid of possible hyperparameter combinations.

When performing grid search, we split the training set into "training" and
"validation" sets. The validation set is used to determine how well the model
*should* perform on new data. We select the best model based on it's performance
on the validation set. We then test the model with the test set.

We do *not* want to include the test set in any grid search validation.
Otherwise, we "leak" data - the model's hyperparameters will be learned in part
on the test set, which we need to avoid. This is why we split the training data
into test / validation sets.

The grid search process:
------------------------
1. Define a grid of hyperparameter values to test.
2. Split the training set into training / validation sets.
3. Train and validate a model w/ each hyperparameter combination.
4. Save the hyperparameter combination which scored the best on the validation
   set using cross validation.
5. Retrain the model with the saved hyperparameters and full training set.
6. Evaluate the model on the test set.

Important: grid search is an expensive process. For each hyperparameter
combination, we generate `k` models to perform cross validation. Assuming you
have a 3*4 grid of parameters with ``5 fold CV, 12 * 5 == 60 models will be
created and evaluated.

The goal of grid search is to find the optimal set of hyperparameters. Every
grid will have an "optimal" set of parameters chosen from the values in the
grid. But how do you know if you have the correct values in your grid? How do
you know better values don't exist?

Examining accuracy results either textually or in a heatmap will show you how
each combination scored. There are a few indicators that will tell you if you've
chosen the correct ranges of hyperparameters.

* Ideally, the highest accuracy model will fall in the middle of the
  hyperparameter grid for each parameter. That reflects each parameter's range
  has been set correctly. Both ends of the parameter's range have been
  evaluated.

* If the best scores are on the edges (w/ maximum or minimum values for 1 or
  more parameters), your search space is not wide enough for those parameters.
  The model may get more accurate if you increase or decrease those parameter
  values.

* If accuracy is not changing between the min / max values of a parameter,
  either the parameter is not important to the results or you haven't chosen a
  wide enough search space for that parameter. Try increasing the range of the
  parameter. If the increased range still yields consistent accuracy, that
  parameter is not important to tune (or perhaps could be eliminated).


---


Model metrics (scoring)
-----------------------

Binary classification
---------------------------------
Binary classification is classifying data into two groups. There are 4 ways an
individual result could turn out:

* True positive: correctly predicted positive.
* False positive: incorrect positive prediction. Type 1 error.
* False negative: incorrect false prediction. Type 2 error.
* True negative: correctly predicted negative.

When evaluating a binary classifier, associate a cost to each error type. For
example, when predicting cancer, the cost of a false negative (type 2) is *much*
higher than a false positive (type 1). If you predict a false positive, the
patient would need to have more tests performed which would ultimately prove no
cancer. If you predict a false negative, the patient truly has cancer and
doctors will think they are fine.

Watch for imbalanced data sets. If 99% of emails are spam, simply predicting
every email will be spam will be 99% accurate. With imbalanced data sets,
accuracy is an inadequate measure for quantifying predictive performance.

We need alternative metrics to determine which models perform well.

Confusion Matrix
----------------
A confusion matrix gives you the true / false positive / negative counts.


Precision-Recall curve
----------------------

Binary classification models have a precision / recall tradeoff. Precision is
how accurate your positives are. Recall is how accurate you are at predicting
positives (Recall == True Positive Rate).

* Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)
* Precision = TP / (TP + FP)
* Recall = TP / (FP + FN)

There is a tradeoff in precision vs. recall. You can have 100% precision by only
predicting the sample you are most confident in as positive. However, you'll
miss a lot of positives (high false negatives) and your recall will suffer. If
you lower the confidence interval, you'll have high false positives (low
precision).

The goal is to determine how agressive you want to be when predicting positives.
The optimal threshold is found by testing all thresholds and finding the best
one.

When evaluting a model, the more accurate overall model will have the highest
area under the "receiver operator curve". The "receiver operator curve" is the
graph of true positive rate over false positive rate. The higher the AUC, the
higher the ability for a model to classify correctly across all thresholds.

Define your goals
-----------------

Often, the goal is not to have the most accurate overall model. You may want to
have high precision (confident in your positives) or high recall (low false
negatives). If you are diagnosing people with cancer for example, you want high
recall (low false negatives). Predicting someone as *not* having cancer when
they indeed do is MUCH more expensive than predicting someone as having cancer
who doesn't.

    Cross validation is a more robust way to assess generalization performance.

    Cross validation splits data into multiple "folds", building a model on each
    fold. Scores are determined on each fold. The aggregate score (mean, for
    example) is determined for an overall model "score".

    The goal of CV is to more accurately determine model performance by using
    multiple variations of the test dataset. This provides a "strength in
    numbers" approach

    Benefits of CV:

    1. All data is used in a test set.

    Cross validation is more robust since multiple train / test splits are
    scored. Also, all data is used in a test set in one of the folds. This gives
    us more confidence in the overall model generalization performance (score\).

    By default, train_test_split will randomly create the train / test split. If
    we are "unlucky" and receive all hard to score examples in our test set, the
    model score will be artificially low. CV uses *all* data as test data at one
    point, giving us a better idea of our model's true score.

    2. CV helps determine model sensitivity.

    When we see accuraces between, say, 80% and 90%, we can be reasonably
    confident our overall model performance will be somewhere in the 80%s.

    A wider variance gives us less confidence in overall model performance.

    3. We use our data more effectively.

    The more folds we use, the more data we can include in the training set,
    which generally results in better model performance.

    You can determine the optimum threshold by testing all possible combinations

    that RF performs better at both ends of the spectrum, for very high recall

    each model to determine which is better.

    Average precision is the integral (or area) under the precision-recall
