"""Examples of using custom classes in python.

Class objects support two kinds of operations: attribute references (data and
method references) and instiantiation.

Classes can be created anywhere - within functions, within an `if` statement,
etc. Classes introduce a new scope and the class object itself is added to it's
enclosing scope (typically a module).

Classes, like python itself, are dynamic. They are created at runtime and can be
modified further after creation.

You cannot hide data in Python. All hiding is based on convention. (Underscore
prefixes, etc)

* Members are, but default, public. Methods are virtual (can be overridden).
* Methods are declared with a specific `self` first argument representing the
  object, which is provided implicitly by the call.
* Built-in types can be used as base classes.
* Like C++, most built-in operators with special syntax (arithmetic operators)
  can be redefined for class instances (==, +=)


To test:

* Multiple inheritance
* `global` and `nonlocal`. (Nonlocal can rebind variables found outside the
  innermost scope). If not declared `nonlocal`, variables found outside the
  innermost scope are read-only.
