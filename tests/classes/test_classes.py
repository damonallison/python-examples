"""Examples of classes in python.

Class objects support two kinds of operations: attribute references (data and
method references) and instantiation.

Classes can be created anywhere - within functions, within an `if` statement,
etc. Classes introduce a new scope (namespace) and the class object itself is
added to it's enclosing scope (typically a module).

Classes, like python itself, are dynamic. They are created at runtime and can be
modified further after creation (yuk). For example, attributes and methods can
be added to classes anytime.

You cannot hide data in Python. All hiding is based on convention. (Underscore
prefixes, etc)

* Members are "public". Methods are virtual (can be overridden).
* Methods are declared with a specific `self` first argument representing the
  object, which is provided implicitly during method invocation.
* Built-in types can be used as base classes.
* Like C++, most built-in operators with special syntax (arithmetic operators)
  can be redefined for class instances (==, +=)


Namespaces
----------

* Innermost scope (contains local names)
* The scopes of enclosing functions, which are searched up the callstack.
  * Contains non-local (but non-global) names.
* Current module's global names
* Builtins

* `global` is used to declare varaibles in the module's namespace.
* `nonlocal` is used to reference variables in a parent (not module) namespace.

Classes add another namespace.
