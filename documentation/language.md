# Python

Python was developed as a high level language - friendlier than bash and C.

## Likes

* Flexible. Simple to embed into other programs.
* Small, easy to learn. Guido hit his goal of being "executable pseudocode".
* Great prototyping language.

## Dislikes

* Dynamic typing.

* The core data structures (except tuple) are mutable by default.
    * Swift's `val` and `var` are much more clear, safe.

* Built-in functions vs. objects. Built-ins should be on objects.
    * `del` seems like a complete hack. Put `delete` on all data structure types.
    * `sorted`
    * `zip`
    * `enumerate`

* Heterogeneous lists.
    * `array()` stores homogeneous lists. Specifying an array type feels awkward.

* Multiple base classes

* `self`

* Data encapsulation is impossible in python. It's done by convention. Yuk.

### Scopes (Lexical)

* Innermost scope (block or function)
* Enclosing scope (outer function or class)
* Module global scope
* Built-ins

* `nonlocal` binds a variable higher in the enclosing scope to the current scope.
* `global` binds a variable in the global scope to the current scope.
