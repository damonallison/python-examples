# Data Science From Scratch - Joel Grus

Data is growing unbounded. The goal of DS is to turn that data into insight.

The most important traits to becoming a data scientist are:

* Inquisitive
* Growth mindset
* Hard work

Foundational concepts:

* Probability
* Statistics
* Linear Algebra

Libraries:

* NumPy
* scikit-learn
* pandas

Python is not the best language, but it's great for quick prototyping and bootstrapping.
