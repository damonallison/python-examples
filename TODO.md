# TODO

## Language

* Immutable classes
* Decorators
* Module / Package system (imports / exports / scoping)
  * `__import__(module)` - is `import` a statement and function?
* Builtins
* Example of list comprehension?
    `[_convert_name(name) for name in names]`
* Language - object orientation, encapsulation.
* Green threads / async await
* Typing
* Annotations
* Lexical scoping rules

## Environment

* Virtual environments (`pyenv` and `poetry`)
* What environment variables can be setup to run globally? (`.pythonrc`?)
* `pip`

* Where are python standard modules on disk?
* Where does PIP (PIP3) install new modules?

* Virtual environments : anaconda vs. virtualenv / pip
  * Why was Anaconda created? Is the python ecosystem that difficult to configure properly?

## Visual Studio Code

* Logpoints. Like breakpoints, but it logs a message to the console and does not stop the program.
* Python files.exclude generation

## Libraries

* pytest
* mypy
* flask
* black
