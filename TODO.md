# TODO

## Language

* Module / Package system (imports / exports / scoping)

* Example of list comprehension?
    `[_convert_name(name) for name in names]`

* `__import__(module)` - is `import` a statement and function?

## Libraries

* `unittest`
  * Graphical test runner? Run from VS Code?

* `sys`
* `os.path`

## Environment

* What is `__init__.py` and `__main__.py`?
* `def __init__` - constructor?

* What environment variables can be setup to run globally? (`.pythonrc`?)

## Distributions

* Get Anaconda running.
  * Why was Anaconda created? Is the python ecosystem that difficult to configure properly?

## Modules

* Where are python standard modules on disk?
* Where does PIP (PIP3) install new modules?
* What is PyPi?

## Visual Studio Code

* Logpoints. Like breakpoints, but it logs a message to the console and does not stop the program.
