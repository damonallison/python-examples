# TODO

* What makes Python so popular for data science?
  * Interpreted? REPL?

## Distributions

* Get Anaconda running.
  * Why was Anaconda created? Is the python ecosystem that difficult to configure properly?

## Modules

* Where are python standard modules on disk?
* Where does PIP (PIP3) install new modules?
* What is PyPi?

## Visual Studio Code

* Logpoints. Like breakpoints, but it logs a message to the console and does not stop the program.
