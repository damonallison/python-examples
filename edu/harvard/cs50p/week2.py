"""
Week 2: Loops

Note that as we loop, we do not introduce a new variable scope like we do a
function.

* while: evaluate a boolean again and again.
* ensure your while loops have a logical end state and focus on edge cases
  (boundaries)
* make everything zero based (avoid off by one errors)
* `_` indicates the variable is unused

* function encapsulation / abstraction (interface based programming).
