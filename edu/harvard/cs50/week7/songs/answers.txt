If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?

I would categorize their aura as purple or orange as they have both high energy and danceability.

Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

Every song has equal weight, thus it doesn't reflect the time they've spent listening to music. Giving a higher priority or weight to music they've listened to more would better reflect their aura.
